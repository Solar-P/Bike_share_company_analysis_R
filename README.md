## *Project Description*

This project aims to determine how users' behaviour differs with and without a subscription. It will use this information to support a future marketing campaign. The project consists of two files: a basic analysis and some geospatial analysis. Please start with the bike-share-company-case-study.ipynb file.

***Note: Due to the size of the bike-share-company-case-study.ipynb file sometimes cannot be opened on the first try, If that happens, please try switching between the files again.***
